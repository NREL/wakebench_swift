What to submit?
===============

Where should I upload my simulation results to?
-----------------------------------------------

If you signed up, you should have received a link to a private cloud folder hosted at NREL. Please upload all of your results to that folder, respecting the requested file naming convention which is detailed in :ref:`Benchmark Simulations <simulations>`.

What should I upload?
---------------------

Please go to :ref:`Benchmark Simulations <simulations>` for detailed information on files requested. Here is a quick summary:

**Benchmarks Phase 1: Code Calibration (COMPLETED)**

- Simulation setup (1 file)
- Atmospheric inflow to the wind turbine (1 file)
- Wind turbine response to the inflow (1 file)
- Total of 3 files

**Benchmarks Phase 2: Blind Comparison**

**Please keep results for each benchmark separate, in folders called neutral, unstable and stable.**

- Simulation setup (1 file)
- Simulated flow (9 files, one per downstream distance: -2.5 D and 1 D through 8 D in 1 D increments)
- Wind turbine response to the inflow (1 file)
- Total of 11 files

**Benchmarks Phase 3: Iteration**

**Please keep results for each benchmark separate, in folders called neutral, unstable and stable.**

- Simulation setup (1 file)
- Simulated flow (9 files, one per downstream distance: -2.5 D and 1 D through 8 D in 1 D increments)
- Wind turbine response to the inflow (1 file)
- Text file (1 file) explaining any updates made to the code for the newly uploaded iteration of the solution
- Total of 12 files
