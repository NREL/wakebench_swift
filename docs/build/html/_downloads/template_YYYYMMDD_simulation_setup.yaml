# Example file for simulation setup
# Guidelines:
# - The values provided herein are mere examples
# - You will need to add and remove parameters
# - Populate this file with all relevant parameters of your model
# - For each parameter, please include: name, value, unit, and description
# - For each time you submit new results to the benchmark, please update this
#    file to reflect your simulation settings
# - When relevant, add information about turbine_model and wake_model as well
