# IEA Wind Task 31 "WakeBench"
# Work Package 2
# Phase 3
# The SWiFT Benchmarks
#
# Example file for wind turbine response for time-stepping simulation tools
#
# Requested variables:
# - time_[s]
# - hub_wind_speed_[m_s-1]
# - rotor_power_[kW]
# - rotor_torque_[N_m]
# - rotor_speed_[rpm]
# - blade_pitch_[deg]
# - blade_root_flap_moment_[N_m]
# - blade_root_edge_moment_[N_m]
# - generator_power_[kW]
# - generator_torque_[N_m]
#
# Guidelines:
# - Ensure your results make sense
# - Check your units
# - Use nan for missing values
