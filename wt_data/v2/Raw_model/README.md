# Radius definition
The radius `r` in the file Blade\_Aero.csv follows FAST7 convention, it is the distance from the rotor apex to the beginning of a blade station. The value `dr` represents the extent of the blade station. Typically the aerodynamic control point will be located at the middle of the blade station.


The radius `BldSpan` in the file Blade\_Aero_OF2.csv follows the OpenFAST2 convention, it is the distance from the root of the blade. The calculation points are located at these spanwise locations.
